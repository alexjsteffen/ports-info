This is a simple graphical utility to see ports that are listening for connections on a linux system. To put it simply, it sorts all servers running on your system, which can accept incoming connections.

The app runs netstat and ss under the hood. It requires admin priviledges to display additional info (process/command/PID).

There are packages for Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/Redhat. Head to the releases section to download.

You can also run the app directly from source. See the requirements.txt to know which modules you need to install.
